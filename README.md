## Project Description

The project involves creating a complete hydroponic system with electronic components and 3D-printed parts. The main objective is to develop a functional version of a hydroponic system to grow plants efficiently and automatically. This connected mini apartment garden is perfect for urban plant enthusiasts! 🌱🏙️

## Components Used

* **3 Pogo Connectors (magnetic and clippable)** 🔌 (for easy and secure connections)
* **Pump** 💦 (for water circulation)
* **Water Level Sensor** 🌊 (to monitor the water level in the reservoir)
* **ESP32** 📡 (for control management and wireless communication)
* **DHT Sensor** 🌡️ (to measure temperature and humidity)
* **Photoresistor** 🌞 (to measure light, some models can be modified)
* **RGBW LED Strip** 🌈 (for customized lighting)
* **Soil Moisture Sensor** 🍃 (to monitor soil moisture for plants)

The system will be controlled via the ESP32 and will include advanced features to manage interactions and growing conditions.

## Project Goals

* **Full Automation** : The system will be fully automated to monitor and adjust growing conditions in real-time.
* **Future Improvements** : Integrate additional features to make the system more robust and adaptable to different growing conditions.

## Project Folders

* **3D-files** : Contains all the necessary files for 3D printing, including DXF, STEP, and Fusion 360 files.
* **Firmware** : This folder is currently empty but will soon contain the code for the ESP32.
* **Images** : Contains images showing the appearance and assembly of the hydroponic system.

## To Do

* \[X\] **3D Modeling** : All 3D modeling is complete and functional.
* \[ \] **Control System** : Develop a complete control system to manage the hydroponic system remotely.
* \[ \] **Code** 💻 : Create a version of the code for the ESP32 to control the system via a user interface.

## Project Context

This project was carried out as part of an IF3B course unit. I handled the 3D modeling, electronics, and code. However, the initial code is not fully functional as it was designed to work with Node-RED and MQTT, which was the responsibility of my group colleagues. Their integration does not meet the future needs I wish to associate with this project. Therefore, there is currently no code available, but it should be coming soon.
